### control flow

The order in which individual statements / instructions / function calls of an imperative program are executed / evaluated. A `control flow statement` is a statement that results in a choice of which of two or more paths to follow. 

### declarative programming

A programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing exactly how it has to be done (its [`control flow`](#control-flow)). CodeQL is a language with a declarative nature (pretty common for database query languages, as well as in logic programming). It also attempts to minimize / eliminate side effects.

### imperative programming

A programming paradigm that uses statements to change a program's state. It focusses on _how_ a program operates, implementing algorithms in explicit steps.
